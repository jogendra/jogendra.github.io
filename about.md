Hi, Iâ€™m Jogendra, Class of 2020 Graduate and Post Graduate from **Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi**. I am an iOS / Web Developer and an active Open Source contributor. I like/love to work on different tech stacks. Currently, I am working with [Fynch](https://fynchmobility.com/) as Full Stack Mobile Engineer.

In the past, I worked with [ZestMoney](https://www.zestmoney.in/) as Backend Engineer, with [Zomato](https://www.zomato.com/) as an iOS Developer Intern, I was Google Summer of Code (2018) Student for FOSSASIA, an iOS Developer Intern at [Wheelstreet Inc.](https://www.wheelstreet.com/), and a Software Developer Intern at [Vertext Infosoft](https://vertexinfosoft.com/). I mentored several Open Source Programs including Google Code-In 2018 and Google Summer of Code (2019) students. I love to work with tech communities. In past, I was [GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/jogendra/) and also a maintainer & core contributor to [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org/).

Apart from Coding, I love _Aviation_ :airplane:, and _Travelling_. Every machine that fly in sky, excites me and I aspire to fly them someday. You can track [my travels on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jogendrafx/). I likes to read/watch programming and aviation related blogs/articles/videos in my free time.

You can find me at these places but the most reliable way to reach me is Twitter.
