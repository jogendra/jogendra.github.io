Hi, I’m Jogendra, final year student at **Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi**. I am an iOS / Web Developer, [GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/jogendra/) and an active Open Source contributor. I love/know to design with [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). Currently, I am working with [Zomato](https://www.zomato.com/) as an iOS Developer.

In the past, I was a Google Summer of Code (2018) Student for FOSSASIA, an iOS Developer Intern at [Wheelstreet Inc.](https://www.wheelstreet.com/), and a Software Developer Intern at [Vertext Infosoft](https://vertexinfosoft.com/). I mentored several Open Source Programs including Google Code-In 2018 and mentoring Google Summer of Code (2019) students. I am a maintainer and core contributor to [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org/).

Apart from Coding, I love going Hackathons, attending Conferences, and Travelling.

You can find me at these places but the most reliable way to reach me is to send an email.
