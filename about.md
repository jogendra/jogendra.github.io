Hi, Iâ€™m Jogendra.

Originally from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ and currently based in Amsterdam, Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

Iâ€™m a software engineer working across backend and iOS.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m deeply passionate about aviation. What began as a covid-time fascination with flying machines has grown into something more meaningful â€” Iâ€™m now a Student Pilot at KLM Aeroclub, training toward my Private Pilot License (A). I aspire to carry my passion for aviation beyond flying itself, by building something impactful at the intersection of technology and the skies.

Football and cricket are my go-to sports â€” I love the thrill of the game, both playing and watching the action. Sometimes, I [create digital drawings and capture beautiful aerial views](https://www.instagram.com/flaps.out/) flying my DJI Mini 3 Pro drone.

I graduated in 2020 with a Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degree in Engineering Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi.
